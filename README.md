# PHPChatSSO
Contains client files for integrating Single Sign On and Single Registration in PHP with a Website Toolbox Chat Room.
The following files are included in this repo.

chat_room_sso_functions.php This is the main file you need. You don't need any other file in your project. You just need to give your chat room address and forum API Key at the top of the script. Then you can drop this file anywhere that you can access it on your site.
registration_example.php This file offers an example usage for user registration. You can customize this page or start from scratch.
login_example.php This file offers an example usage for SSO login. You can customize this page or start from scratch.
logout_example.php This file offers an example usage for SSO logout. You can customize this page or start from scratch.
userDeletion_example.php This file offers an example usage for user deletion via SSO API. You can customize this page or start from scratch.
setPassword_example.php This file offers an example usage for set password for user via SSO API. You can customize this page or start from scratch.
Note that PHP's cURL extension is required. That is installed on most servers by default.
